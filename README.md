# Synthesis
Throughout this lab, I have learned various essential concepts and techniques in machine learning and deep learning:
1.	Data preprocessing: Cleaning, standardization, and normalization are crucial steps to prepare data for modeling.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and patterns helps in understanding the dataset better.
3.	Data Augmentation: Techniques like oversampling and undersampling can help address class imbalance issues.
4.	Deep Neural Network Architecture: Designing neural network architectures for classification tasks involves defining layers, activation functions, and output layers.
5.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Using tools like GridSearchCV helps in finding the best hyperparameters for the model.
6.	Visualization: Plotting loss and accuracy curves helps in understanding model training and performance.
7.	Metrics Calculation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score provides insights into its effectiveness.
8.	Regularization Techniques: Applying techniques like dropout and weight decay helps prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
Overall, this lab has provided a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of machine learning and deep learning, equipping me with valuable skills for tackling real-world problems in predictive maintenance and other domains.
